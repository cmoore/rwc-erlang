  Wed. Oct. 1: I'm planning on pushing a patch tonight to enable direct messages.

<div class="about">
  This site was born out of frustration with all current twitter and identica clients.  That's about it.  The site runs on a single dual-processor XServe, and is written completely in <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.  If you like the site please let me (twitter/identica:hydo) know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coming Soon:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Direct messages.  At the moment you can't even see them.  They come back from the services with a much different format than the friends timeline.  It's not really a big deal, just one that I haven't taken the time to tackle yet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Public Timeline.
    </li>
    <li>
      @ replies should highlight the whole message box or something like that.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag links.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="about">
  Version: 0.5.2<br>
  &nbsp;Tweaked the message formatting just a bit and added the [@] button and controls to enable/disable the correct service to reply to the message.  Try the button, you'll see what I mean.
