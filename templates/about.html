  This site was born out of frustration with all current twitter and identica clients.  That's about it.  The site runs on a single dual-processor XServe, and is written completely in <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.  If you like the site please let me (twitter/identica:hydo) know.

  Coming Soon in order:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Direct messages.  At the moment you can't even see them.  They come back from the services with a much different format than the friends timeline.  It's not really a big deal, just one that I haven't taken the time to tackle yet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Public Timeline.
    </li>
    <li>
      @ replies should highlight the whole message box or something like that.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag links.
    </li>
  </ul>
