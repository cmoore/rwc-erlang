ROYALE WITH CHEESE

This project is intended to be used under the [mecha_server](http://github.com/hydo/mecha_server/tree) umbrella though it will definitely run as a standalone app.  Take a look at [mecha_server/etc/yaws.conf](http://github.com/hydo/mecha_server/blob/5c53b75d3e41a52a3d7168c27fa0014654f3924a/etc/yaws.conf) for an example of running it under Yaws.

I'll be refactoring this project to use [BeepBeep](http://github.com/davebryson/beepbeep/tree/master) in the next few days.
