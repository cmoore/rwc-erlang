This is/will be a twitter and identica aggregator that uses ping.fm to send
updates geared toward the iphone but will work in any browser.  At the moment
though it only partially works.  If you are the adventurous type you can ... 

GETTING IT RUNNING -

You'll need:
erlang
yaws

1 - Copy Emakefile.sample to Emakefile and change the paths for Yaws and xmerl
2 - Copy start.sh.sample to start.sh and change YAWS_DIR and NAME if you like.
3 - Run start.sh and see what happens.

Most of the stuff here is fairly self contained.  There are a few tunables in
src/dorkinator.erl as well including the listening port.  Otherwise you should be
able to just run ./start.sh and open a browser to localhost:3000.  Reports on the
success or failure of this are definitely welcomed.

Usage -

Once it's built and running, go to localhost:3000/t/setup and enter in your twitter
and identica info.  The page should refresh to /t/viewer and should list your tweets
etc. from both services.  That's as much as is working at the moment.

Contact moc.cam@odyh with patches, questions, suggestions, etc.  Seriously, I listen
to suggestions.  Bring 'em on.

I'm going to work on a quickie development overview for people who might want to 
hack on this to get them going faster.  I also seem to uncover quite a lot of 
cruft and stupid mistakes when I write docs for a my own projects so it's not 
entirely a selfless act.

This code has been tested on
- Mac OS X / Server 10.5 using the MacPorts build of Erlang and YAWS.
- FreeBSD / using the ports version of Erlang and YAWS.

Plans/Ideas/Etc.

- Explore the possibility of doing a whole ui in dashcode.  There's several pretty 
cool things that are Safari-specific that might be fun to mess with.  For instance
the simple client-side database system would be a nice place to possibly store
authentication info.  Or, maybe not.  With or without the safari-specific stuff
a dashcode interface would be pretty slick.
