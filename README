This is/will be a twitter and identica aggregator that uses ping.fm to send updates.

There's not a whole lot to see here just yet as everything is in varying states of disarray.

GETTING IT RUNNING -

Most of the stuff here is fairly self contained.  You'll definitely want to edit start.sh
and src/dorkinator.erl and change the paths.  Also, unless you have yaws installed in 
/usr/local/lib/yaws, you'll need to edit the Emakefile.  Otherwise you should be able to
just run ./start.sh and open a browser to localhost:3000.  Reports on the success or 
failure of this are welcomed.

TODO - A definitely incomplete list

- lwtc needs to be refactored to take a mode setting depending on if the caller is trying
to talk to identi.ca or twitter.

- the validation code in the handlers for POST actions needs to actually validate.  It
doesn't at the moment for testing.

- lwtc needs to spawn a process to hold l/p information instead of putting it into ETS.
that or something else that would make me feel better about giving it my login credentials
if it were someone elses project running on someone else's machine.
